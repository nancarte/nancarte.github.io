# EDA of ATP Data
### In this blog post I will explore the ATP tennis data by creating figures
### Introduction

I have been interested in tennis for quite a long time so I decided I would web scrape data about professional tennis players and explore it. I got my data from the ATP which is the top tennis tour for men. The data I web scraped is a list of the top 250 ATP tennis players along with information associated with those tennis players. The Rank variable is what players on the ATP tour are ranked based on how many points they have earned at the time I got this data. Points are earned based on if a player wins or loses at certain points in a tournament and what tournament that player is playing in. Grand slams are the four tournaments each year that give the most points.

### Rank vs. Tournaments Played

The first figure I created is a scatterplot with Rank on the y-axis and Tournaments Played on the x-axis. Some observations are that none of the grand slam winners have played more than 25 tournaments while many other players have. I think this is partially because grand slam winners don't have to play as many tournaments to maintain their relatively higher ranking as they earn more points playing in the top tournaments. Those that haven't won grand slams or aren't ranked near the top have to play a lot of tournaments to maintain or improve their ranking or else their ranking could drop considerably which could end their career.

### Rank vs. Age

The second scatterplot I made has Rank on the y-axis and Age on the x-axis. One thing I notice is that grand slam winners are generally older than the rest of the ATP tour. There are not a lot of players in their thirties and older but five of the eight grand slam winners are older than 30.

### Top Ten Countries with Most Players

The first barplot I made is a count of players for each country. One of the first things I paid attention to is that the top five countries for number of ATP players in the top 250 have zero grand slams. Honestly the main reason for this is the dominance of just a few men winning the vast majority of grand slams in recent history.

### Points vs. Country Boxplots for Top 10 Countries

Next I made a figure containing multiple boxplots of points for each country. These boxplots show that even though the USA, Argentina, France, Italy, and Australia have the most players they don't in general have players with a very large amount of points.

### Points for Grand Slam Winners and Everyone Else

For the second boxplot I made it is clear that in general those that have won grand slams have more points than those that haven't. If someone were to make a prediction about someone that hasn't won a grand slam yet but will win a grand slam it would make sense to predict that the two players that have more than 5000 points will win one during their career.

### Histogram of Points

Next I made a histogram of points. This shows that a typical ATP player in the top 250 has 
less than 1000 points and very few have more than 4000. The main reason for this is that winning grand slams and other top tournaments is worth way more points than other tournaments. This means that a handful of players have way more points than the rest of the players.

### Correlation Matrix

Finally I created a correlation matrix of the numeric variables. Rank and points have a somewhat strong negative correlation becuase as rank goes up by 1 for each player the amount of points the player has is less than the higher ranked player. It makes sense there is a moderately positive correlation between grand slams and points because grand slam winners are typically players that win more points because they win more matches. Normally I imagine this correlation would be even stronger because there are some grand slam winners that are lower ranked probably because of injuries or older age.

### Conclusion

This EDA focused on what insights could be extracted about grand slam winners. My next post will have the same focus. It is expected that grand slam winners would have more points, be ranked higher, and perhaps that they would play less tournaments. It is probably not expected that no players from the top five countries with the most players in the top 250 have no grand slam winners.
