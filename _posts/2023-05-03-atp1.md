### Introduction
I have played tennis for a long time and I am interested in the ATP which is why I chose to obtain this data. 

### Obtaining Final Data Set
To obtain the final data set I got information from two sources. I scraped the ATP Tour website and a website called tennisexplorer. Most of the data came from the ATP Tour website while one column came from the tennisexplorer website. I faced some challenges getting this data set. One of the challenges was that many websites didn't have enough players in their rankings. One different challenge was that some websites didn't have the country of players from Russia becuase they aren't allowed to represent Russia currently.

### Details of Obtaining Data Set
I used BeautifulSoup to obtain my dataset. I don't have much experience with APIs which is why I decided to use BeautifulSoup and used code that was familiar to me.
```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
import re
r = requests.get(url)
r.status_code
soup = BeautifulSoup(r.content, 'html.parser')
```
I used list comprehensions to get my data as well as soup.find_all where I found specific classes such as the code below.
```
rank = soup.find_all(class_='rank-cell border-left-4 border-right-dash-1')
rank1 = [i.string for i in rank]
```
After getting the data from the ATP Tour website I got data from tennisexplorer. There were many more things I did to clean the data into the data I wanted but to keep this post short I won't go into details. My dataset ended up looking like this.
