### Introduction

While working at Murch as an intern I and four other interns created a survey that asked what people thought of Murch. After obtaining the data I analyzed the data and did text analysis as well as Logistic Regression. The text analysis I did included creating unigram bar charts and using BERTopic for Topic Modeling.

### Unigram Bar Charts

The bar charts I created are the top ten unigrams of responses from specific questions. The first one is a unigram for clothing types.

### Clothing Type Unigram

This unigram identifies shirts, dresses, and shoes as the top three clothing items that those that were taking the survey want to be on Murch. Dresses and shoes were not on Murch before we took this survey so it is helpful information for Murch to consider adding these clothing types to their website.

### Inconveniences Unigram

This unigram shows that trying clothes on and dealing with the fit/size are the main inconveniences people have about shopping online.

### Social Media Unigram

This unigram shows that by far Instagram is the most popular form of social media for buying clothes online. Because of this Murch should initially focus on Instagram for social media and as they grow expand where they post on social media.

### Topic Modeling

Further text analysis was done with BERTopic which attempts to create topics out of the text. The first one created topics from the responses about what the company did. The second one created topics from inconveniences. Below is a visualization of the topics for what the company did.

### Topic Modeling

Further text analysis was done with BERTopic which attempts to create topics out of the text. The first one created topics from the responses about what the company did. The second one created topics from inconveniences. Below is a visualization of the topics for what the company did. Topic 0 could be labeled as Murch because the words are things that Murch does. Topic 1 is showing that there were responses like yes, think, yeah, kind, sort which shows that some of the responses werenâ€™t really descriptions  but more bad responses to the question. Below is the visualization of the topics for inconveniences.

Topic 0 could be labeled Clothing fit because it is showing that people have inconveniences by using those kinds of words. Topic 1 could be Inability to try on because the response try is showing responses want to try on clothes but are unable to when buying online. Topic 2 could be problems with shipping/delivery.
